### 1. How to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor and Least Common Multiple

The Greatest Common Divisor is the largest possible number that will divide into 2 given numbers. the first step towards finding the GCD of the 2 numbers is to first find out all the divisors for both numbers. Then you compare the two lists of divisors and look for the largest one that they share. 

The Least Common Multiple is the smallest number that is a multiple of 2 given numbers. To find out the LCM you can use a similar process to finding the GCD. firstly you make a list of X ammount of muliples for each number, e.g. Multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and the multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21. Now you just look for the first number that appears in both lists. In this case, the LCM of 3 and 7 is 21.
